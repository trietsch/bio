As said [before](/about), I like to tinker around with technology, also at home. I've always wanted to build my own
version of a word clock, ever since I saw one from [Qlocktwo](https://qlocktwo.com/en/qlocktwo-classic/) at a store.

Together with my girlfriend, I've built my own version of the Qlocktwo word clock. Using WS2812b LED strips, a Raspberry
Pi 3B, some wood, a soldering iron, and a lot of patience, we've built our own version of a word clock.
Oh, and of course, we got help from the Open Source community, as we
used [this](https://github.com/bk1285/rpi_wordclock/) project as a starting point.

I needed to modify the code, as at that time the layout for the Dutch language was not available. You can find my
version
of the code [here](https://gitlab.com/trietsch/rpi_wordclock). It has been running for 6 years now, and in [contrast to
iPhones](https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/27/another-daylight-saving-time-bug-strikes-apples-ios-7-affects-calendar-display),
it does not suffer from Daylight Saving Time bugs.

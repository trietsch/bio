Below is a list of talks and blog posts I have given or written. I love to share knowledge, so I try to give a talk or write a blog post occasionally. If you are interested in me giving a talk at your meetup or conference, please reach out to me (see contact details on the [home page](/)).

Some talks are not listed here, but I have various materials available for different topics I have given talks about.

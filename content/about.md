Hi!

> My name is **Robin** üëã, and I am an **experienced software engineer** üë®‚Äçüíª, building **highly available applications** in a **cloud native stack**.

I've been in a lead role for several years now, teaching junior/medior developers and coordinating team workload.

I am not shy of using new technologies, I am a fast learner, and I try to always determine what the best tool for the job is.  From using Kubernetes to public clouds (GCP, AWS, Azure), setting up infrastructure as Code (Terraform) or CI/CD, and also deploying and configuring identity providers (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect; Keycloak) belong to my skill set.
Furthermore, I am familiar with various transport layer protocols, ranging from HTTP (REST apps), gRPC, to GraphQL.

If I've never done something before, I will dive into details and documentation, to make sure I understand how technology works, in order to successfully use it.

Love a technical challenge, will persevere until the goal is reached. I do weigh benefits against effort and time spent, to make a realistic decision.

Most important learning over the past years: use the right tool for the job. This is how I learned to use several new technologies and languages that were a better fit for the problem at hand.

In my private life, I enjoy spending time with my family, love swimming and love to tinker with technology! This is also how I got into home automation (I've created the [Quatt app](https://github.com/trietsch/io.quatt) for [Homey](https://homey.app/nl-nl/app/io.quatt/Quatt/)).

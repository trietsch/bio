I have been asked a few times why I have a banana on my website. Whilst testing the software that I write, I often need
to generate dummy data. You could use a [faker library](https://github.com/DiUS/java-fakerv) for that. But where's the
fun in that?

Well, I decide to use fruits as a theme for my dummy data. Whenever you see a banana in the test code, there's a good
chance that I wrote it.

Next to that, it catches your attention! Which is a good thing, especially when debugging. There's often a large chunk
of logs to comb through, so, just search for the 🍌!

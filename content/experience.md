STRM Privacy aims to be the data layer for the privacy age, meaning that we're building an event processing platform that respects the demands that we have nowadays as end-users. We don't necessarily just click accept all cookies blindly anymore, but we think about the data that is collected and how it is used. At STRM Privacy, we're building an event processing platform that encrypts sensitive data, such that it respects these privacy demands.

As a Software Engineer at OpenValue, I work at various customers. Customers range from the Dutch National Police to banks, though the technology stack always includes Java. I've worked for three customers: Pon (largest Dutch car importer), Rabobank (one of the three major banks in the Netherlands), and STRM Privacy (a privacy focused event processing platform).
